# Markov System Priming

This directory contains components for Markov system priming and stochastic modeling, including:

- Markov chain configurations
- Stochastic process models
- Transition matrices
- Priming sequences
- Random walk generators

This supports the probabilistic reasoning and sequence generation capabilities of the semantic mesh.
