# Markov Layer

goal: host minimal stochastic references (surprisal curriculum, n-gram stats) backing modeling plan features.

current_status:
	- empty placeholders; populate once Markov/entropy feature scripts exist

planned_assets:
	surprisal_buckets.yaml: fold-aware surprisal thresholds (pending)
	kmer_config.yaml: k=3/4/5 n-gram smoothing params (pending)
	entropy_gate_notes.md: rationale for entropy-weighted fusion (pending)

note: keep files lightweight (tables or YAML). No heavy matrices until required by execution plan.
