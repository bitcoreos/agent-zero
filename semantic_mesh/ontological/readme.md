# Ontological Systems

This directory contains all materials related to the ontologies discussed in the initial research plan. The purpose of this repository is to create a structured representation of the relationships between concepts, entities, and processes within the Antibody Developability Competition project.

## Purpose

- **Ontology Development**: Create formal representations of knowledge about antibody developability prediction
- **Relationship Mapping**: Define and document relationships between concepts, methods, and entities
- **Semantic Mesh**: Generate a connected network of knowledge that links related concepts across the project
- **Structured Data Storage**: Use JSON, YAML, and other structured formats to represent ontological relationships

## Content Structure

This directory should contain:

- **JSON objects** (.json) for structured data representations and knowledge graphs
- **YAML files** (.yml) for ontology schemas and configuration
- **Markdown files** (.md) for documentation and explanations of ontological relationships
- **Reference ontologies** in standard formats

## Scope

All content in this directory should focus on the ontological aspects of the project, including:

- **Class hierarchies**: Taxonomies of concepts (e.g., types of protein language models, feature engineering methods)
- **Property definitions**: Attributes of concepts and their data types
- **Relationships**: Connections between concepts (e.g., "uses", "extends", "contradicts", "inspired_by")
- **Axioms**: Logical statements that constrain the ontology
- **Instances**: Specific examples of concepts

## Ontological Relationships to Model

- **Methodological relationships**: How different approaches relate (e.g., AntiBERTa extends ESM-2 for antibodies)
- **Feature dependencies**: How features are derived from sequences and models
- **Evaluation metrics**: Relationships between different performance measures
- **Competition constraints**: How rules and requirements constrain the solution space
- **Knowledge provenance**: Sources and references for all concepts

This ontological system will serve as the structural backbone for connecting all semantic knowledge in the project, enabling reasoning, inference, and discovery of new relationships.
