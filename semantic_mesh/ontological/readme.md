# Ontological Systems

This directory contains all materials related to the ontologies discussed in the initial research plan. The purpose of this repository is to create a structured representation of the relationships between concepts, entities, and processes within the Antibody Developability Competition project.

Refer to `ontology_schema/README.md` for the active ontology guidance.
