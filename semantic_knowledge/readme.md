# Semantic Knowledge Base

This directory contains all research and knowledge related to the Antibody Developability Competition as discussed in the initial research plan. The purpose of this repository is to create a comprehensive semantic knowledge base that serves as the foundation for understanding all concepts, methods, and relationships within the project.

## Purpose

- **Glossary**: Define all key terms, acronyms, and concepts used in the research
- **Definitions**: Provide precise definitions of all technical terms and methodologies
- **Semantic Knowledge Base**: Establish relationships between concepts and create a structured representation of domain knowledge
- **Research Repository**: Store all relevant research materials, papers, and references

## Content Structure

This directory should contain:

- **Markdown files** (.md) for conceptual explanations and documentation
- **JSON objects** for structured data representations
- **YAML files** (.yml) for configuration and metadata
- **Reference collections** in structured formats

## Scope

All content in this directory should focus on the semantic aspects of the antibody developability prediction problem, including:

- Protein language models (ESM-2, AntiBERTa, AbLang, BALM)
- Antibody structure and function
- Developability metrics (AC-SINS_pH7.4, PR_CHO, HIC, Tm2, Titer)
- Feature engineering methods (sequence features, Markov models, structure-lite features)
- Machine learning concepts (cross-validation, ensembling, calibration)
- Competition rules and evaluation metrics

This knowledge base will serve as the authoritative source for understanding the meaning and relationships of all concepts used in the project.
