# Gaps, Risks, and Additional Considerations for Antibody Developability Competition

## Licensing and Compatibility Concerns

### IgFold
- **License**: JHU Academic Software License
- **Risk**: May have restrictions on commercial use or specific research applications
- **Mitigation**: Verify license compatibility with competition rules; consider using a compatible fork if necessary
- **Reference**: https://github.com/Graylab/IgFold

### AntiBERTa
- **License**: Not explicitly stated in paper
- **Risk**: Unclear usage rights and redistribution terms
- **Mitigation**: Contact authors for clarification; prefer models with clear open-source licenses
- **Reference**: https://www.cell.com/patterns/pdf/S2666-3899%2822%2900105-2.pdf

### HMMER3
- **License**: Custom license (free for academic use, commercial use requires agreement)
- **Risk**: Potential limitations for certain applications
- **Mitigation**: Confirm intended use case complies with license terms
- **Reference**: https://hmmer.org/

## Technical Risks and Gaps

### Data Leakage Prevention
- **Risk**: Accidental inclusion of test set data in training
- **Mitigation**: Implement strict data partitioning; use the official CV folds
- **Verification**: Check that no antibody pairs appear in both train and validation sets

### Model Overfitting
- **Risk**: High performance on validation set but poor generalization
- **Mitigation**: Use regularization techniques; monitor performance on multiple validation folds
- **Verification**: Implement early stopping based on validation performance

### Feature Engineering Challenges
- **Risk**: Markov/HMM features may not generalize well to unseen sequences
- **Mitigation**: Use cross-validation to assess feature importance; consider ensemble methods
- **Verification**: Compare performance with and without Markov features

### Computational Resource Requirements
- **Risk**: ESM-2 and other large models require significant GPU memory
- **Mitigation**: Use model parallelism or gradient checkpointing; consider smaller variants
- **Verification**: Test model training on a small subset first

## Competition-Specific Risks

### Submission Validation Failures
- **Risk**: Submission rejected due to formatting issues
- **Mitigation**: Implement thorough local validation before submission
- **Verification**: Check for:
  - Correct column names (AC-SINS_pH7.4, PR_CHO, HIC, Tm2, Titer)
  - No NaN values in predicted columns
  - Exactly one row per antibody_name
  - Correct hierarchical_cluster_IgG_isotype_stratified_fold values for CV submissions

### Public Set Spearman Threshold
- **Risk**: Public-set Spearman > 0.9 triggers warning (possible data leakage)
- **Mitigation**: Monitor public set performance; investigate unusually high scores
- **Verification**: Compare local CV results with public leaderboard scores

### Deadline Management
- **Risk**: Missing the November 1, 2025 deadline
- **Mitigation**: Create a detailed timeline with milestones
- **Verification**: Set calendar reminders for key dates

## Additional Considerations

### Reproducibility
- **Action**: Document all steps, versions, and hyperparameters
- **Benefit**: Enables others to reproduce results and build upon work

### Open Science
- **Action**: Consider open-sourcing code and models
- **Benefit**: Aligns with competition spirit; may qualify for top open-source entry prize

### Collaboration
- **Action**: Consider forming a team with complementary expertise
- **Benefit**: Can address multiple aspects of the problem more effectively

### Alternative Approaches
- **Consideration**: Explore different base models (ESM-2, AntiBERTa, AbLang, BALM)
- **Benefit**: Ensemble of diverse models may outperform single approach

### Post-Processing
- **Consideration**: Implement calibration methods (temperature scaling, isotonic regression)
- **Benefit**: May improve prediction reliability

### Uncertainty Estimation
- **Consideration**: Implement methods to estimate prediction uncertainty
- **Benefit**: Can identify low-confidence predictions for further analysis

## Monitoring and Validation

### Local Parity with Leaderboard
- **Action**: Reproduce leaderboard evaluation metrics locally
- **Benefit**: Ensures consistency between local validation and official scoring

### Drift Detection
- **Action**: Implement KL divergence check between train and submission set surprisal distributions
- **Benefit**: Detects potential distribution shifts that could impact performance

### Quality Assurance
- **Action**: Implement automated QA checks before submission
- **Benefit**: Reduces risk of validation failures
